# dependency-parsing
Dependency is a binary asymmetrical relation, which is represented in diagrams by an arrow from the head to the dependent, as shown in below.

This repository is about a re-implementation about some dependency parsing methods.
There have been two major long-established methods for dependency parsing, transition-based parser and graph-based parser.




## Transition-based parser
* Transition-based dependency parsing with stack long short-term memory [pdf](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1033.pdf).

* Globally normalized transition-based neural networks [pdf](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1231.pdf).
* A re-ranking model for dependency parser with recursive convolutional neural network [pdf](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1112.pdf).
