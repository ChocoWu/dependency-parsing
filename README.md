# dependency-parsing
Dependency is a binary asymmetrical relation, which is represented in diagrams by an arrow from the head to the dependent, as shown in below.

This repository is about a re-implementation about some dependency parsing methods.
There have been two major long-established methods for dependency parsing, transition-based parser and graph-based parser.
